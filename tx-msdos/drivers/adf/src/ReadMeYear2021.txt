Notes about the source code:

The source code was basically written during the years 1994 to 1996, this is
during the Windows 95 era, almost 30 years ago. Have that in mind...

It is intentional written to use only 8088/8086 compatible code.

The source is in assembly language only, using the Microsoft Macro Assembler
(ML.EXE) as compiler, with the options: /Cp /W3 /WX /Zp1
